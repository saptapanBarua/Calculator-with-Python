# Python Calculator Project

## Description

This is a basic command-line calculator built with Python. It allows users to perform four fundamental arithmetic operations:

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division

The program also features an option to exit gracefully by entering **Q** or **q**. It is designed to repeatedly ask the user for input until they choose to quit.

## Features

- **Addition**: Adds two numbers.
- **Subtraction**: Subtracts the second number from the first.
- **Multiplication**: Multiplies two numbers.
- **Division**: Divides the first number by the second, with error handling for division by zero.
- **Exit**: The user can exit the calculator by pressing **Q** or **q** at any time.

## Usage

1. Run the program in a Python environment.
2. The user will be prompted to choose one of the following operations:
    - **1**: Addition
    - **2**: Subtraction
    - **3**: Multiplication
    - **4**: Division
3. After selecting the operation, the user will input two numbers.
